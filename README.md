# City-Search
searching for destination city in a randomized graph using different searching algorithms

# Description
This program creates a random graph on a 100X100 grid for any number of instances specified. The nodes are city locations, edges are roads. For each city, 2-5 edges are randomly generated between it and its 5 nearest neighbours. A start node, and goal node are randomly selected. Then uninformed (DFS, BFS, iterative deepening) and informed searching algorithms (best-first search, astar search) are performed. Aggregate results are computed and analyzed, to determine which searching algorithm performs best.

# Sample Output
To do: Add networkx graph examples, and data results
